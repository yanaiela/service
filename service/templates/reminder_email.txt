Dear {reviewer_name},

I am reaching out about a paper for which I'm serving as an area chair (AC), and you are a reviewer.
The paper is called "{paper_title}"

The review deadline has passed, and I need to ensure the paper receives at least 3 reviews.
Are you able to submit a review for this paper in the next day or two?

Best,
{sender_name}
